My name is Elijah Rippeth (he/him). I'm a first year (and #firstgen) PhD student at the University of Maryland in the Department of Computer Science and a computational linguist at the MITRE Corporation. My work focuses broadly on natural language processing, but with a focus on multilingual systems and machine translation.
